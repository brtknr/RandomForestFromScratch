# RandomForestRefactored

This repository chronicles my attempt to understand Random Forest
models by refactoring an existing code from
https://github.com/searene/demos/RandomForest that trains on a small
sample dataset (provided) to make makes prediction. 

To run, simply do this:

    ./random_forest.py
